# Test Plan for Component Testing

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for writing test cases for each component in the project. The aim is to ensure the robustness and correctness of the application by covering various scenarios and functionalities.

## Test Types

We will focus on three main types of tests for each component:

1.Unit Tests:

these tests focus on individual functions or methods within a component.
Cases include validating input/output, edge cases, and handling unexpected scenarios.

2.Integration Tests:

These tests check the interaction between different components to ensure they work together as expected.
Cases include testing the flow of data and events between components.

3.UI/Component Tests:

These tests focus on the visual and interactive aspects of the components.
Cases include rendering correctness, user interactions, and responsiveness.

## Components and Test Cases

1. HeaderComponent
Unit Tests:
1.1. Ensure that the getTitle method returns the correct title.
1.2. Test the behavior of toggleMenu to verify that the menu state is toggled correctly.
1.3. Check the rendering of the component with different props.

Integration Tests:
1.4. Test the integration with the NavigationComponent to ensure the correct menu items are displayed.

UI/Component Tests:
1.5. Verify the correct rendering of the header with different screen sizes.
1.6. Test the interaction of the menu button and dropdown.

2. TodoListComponent
Unit Tests:
2.1. Ensure that the addTodo function correctly adds a new todo item.
2.2. Test the behavior of completeTodo to mark a todo item as completed.
2.3. Check the rendering of the component with different props and states.

Integration Tests:
2.4. Test the integration with TodoItemComponent to ensure proper handling of individual todo items.

UI/Component Tests:
2.5. Verify the correct rendering of todo items and completed todo items.
2.6. Test the interaction of the user with the add todo input field.

3. FooterComponent
Unit Tests:
3.1. Ensure that the getCompletedCount method returns the correct count of completed todos.
3.2. Test the behavior of clearCompleted to remove completed todos.
3.3. Check the rendering of the component with different props and states.

Integration Tests:
3.4. Test the integration with TodoListComponent to ensure proper synchronization of completed todos.

UI/Component Tests:
3.5. Verify the correct rendering of the footer with different counts and states.
3.6. Test the interaction of the user with the "Clear Completed" button.

## To run the test
npm test


## Contribution and Issues
Feel free to contribute to the testing efforts by adding more test cases or improving existing ones. If you encounter any issues, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.

## Continuous Integration
Consider setting up a continuous integration (CI) pipeline to automatically run tests on each code push.
